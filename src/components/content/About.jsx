            Of course you may didn't know me. I am not that famous, okay üòÅ.
            Just an ordinary lady trying to living my life for the best of me.
            Just call me <b>Widiya</b>, though I have many pseudonym, ups.

          <p className=''>
            So I have many fields in my plate. I do programming and UI Designer
            (including experience researcher) since I have Bachelor's degree for
            those. And I love doing digital painting, illustration, and also
            done some design work for branding needs like poster, social media
            promotion (feed or story; I usually take this job for freelance),
            flyer, banner, and more.
