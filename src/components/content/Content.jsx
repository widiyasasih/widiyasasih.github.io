          <h2 className='content-title'>Do you know me already?</h2>
          <div className='body'>
            <p className=''>
              Of course you may didn't know me. I am not that famous, okay üòÅ.
              Just an ordinary lady trying to living my life for the best of me.

            </p>
            <p className=''>
              So I have many fields in my plate. I do programming and UI
              Designer (including experience researcher) since I have Bachelor's
              degree for those. And I love doing digital painting, illustration,
              and also done some design work for branding needs like poster,
              social media promotion (feed or story; I usually take this job for
              freelance), flyer, banner, and more.
